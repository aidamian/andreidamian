      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am an experienced AI expert with over 25 years in the industry, specializing in AI, Deep Learning, MLOps, and Data Science. With two PhDs in Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence and Project Management, as well as a specialization in AI from Stanford, I have honed my skills across a variety of sectors including distribution, retail, logistics, pharmaceuticals, energy, security, and consumer goods.
      </p>
      <p>
        My career has been marked by a commitment to advancing the field of AI and its applications. As a Senior Lecturer at the Polytechnic University of Bucharest, I impart my knowledge of "Data Science with Deep Learning" to masterâ€™s students, fostering the next generation of AI professionals. I am also the founder of Natural.AI, where I explore the intersection of AI and blockchain technology to push the boundaries of what is possible in decentralized AI.
      </p>
      <p>
        My professional journey has included key roles such as Chief Data Scientist at Lummetry.AI, where I specialize in predictive analytics using deep learning, and Founder and CEO of Venture Capital Hub, where I provided consultancy for venture capital and technology startups. My work in these diverse fields has equipped me with a unique perspective and a comprehensive skill set that I bring to every project I undertake.
